        <p>
            This GDPS runs on the most recent 2.2 leak, it
            happened in december 2019 when Robtop leaked new

        <p>
            The answer is related to the question above, the
            leak happened only on the playstore which means
            this GDPS is only playable on Android and on other
            platforms where Android can be emulated such as
            PC using Bluestacks 5 Emulator.

            see on the sneak peek by robtop himself
            (https://youtu.be/g4r6BTdU2M0), allows you to create
            2D platformer-gameplay. This GDPS has also a lot
            of new 2.2 Editor features like particle editor,
            swing copter game-mode, new triggers like song
            trigger, timewarp trigger etc.
